# Autonomous Racing Development

Welcome to our project on **Developing Algorithms for an Autonomous Racing Car on the F1/10 Platform using ROS 2**.

## Project Overview

Our goal was to design, implement, and validate cutting-edge algorithms for autonomous racing using the F1/10 platform. By harnessing the capabilities of **ROS 2**, we created realistic simulation environments that replicate the challenges of real-world racing circuits, allowing us to rigorously test and refine our solutions.

## Key Objectives

- Develop robust algorithms for autonomous navigation  
- Implement advanced control strategies to enhance racing performance  
- Utilize **ROS 2** to simulate complex, dynamic racing environments  

## Technological Innovation

The **F1/10 platform** served as a dynamic proving ground, allowing us to simulate high-speed racing conditions. Our algorithms were designed to handle sharp curves, sudden obstacles, and high-speed turns with precision, enabling reliable and efficient autonomous driving performance.

## ROS 2 Integration

ROS 2 was at the core of our development process, enabling:
- Modular and scalable software architecture  
- Real-time simulation in RViz and Gazebo  
- Enhanced control and feedback systems for trajectory planning and obstacle avoidance  

## Achievements

- Developed and validated navigation algorithms for autonomous racing  
- Integrated and tested advanced control strategies for precision racing  
- Built and tested full simulation environments using ROS 2 and RViz  

## Learning Outcomes

This project offered a deep dive into:
- Motion planning and control for autonomous systems  
- Simulation environment development  
- Collaborative problem solving in a robotics context  

## Team Credits

This project was made possible by the passion and hard work of our team:
- **Venkata Abhiram Rachamalla**  
- **Gopikrishnan Nair**

## Demo Videos

Check out our ROS 2 simulations and visualizations on RViz in the attached demo videos for a closer look at our autonomous racing car in action.

## Future Work

Weâ€™re excited to build upon this foundation by:
- Extending to real-world F1/10 hardware  
- Incorporating machine learning for adaptive control  
- Enhancing perception with LIDAR and camera-based vision systems
